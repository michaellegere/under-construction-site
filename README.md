# under-construction-site
**If you can't tell by my GitHub, I love to make resume/portfolio sites. 
Something about finding new ways to present myself and my experiences is very fun to me. 
This site, built in about two hours one morning, is a quick "under construction" site to hold the place 
of my GH Pages site while I make some big changes.**

## Thoughts behind the Site

This was meant to be a quick placeholder for my domain michaellegere.com while I
built my portfolio site. I came to really like the layout and colors, and ended up
modeling my current portfolio site (as of Aug 15, 2022) after this. That site still
needs work, but I'm fairly happy with where I've ended up thus far.

## What might I improve?

If I were to use this site again, I would likely change two things first: the hero 
and the color scheme. While I do like the simplicity, I think it needs something more
to draw the visitor in. I would also probably change the primary cream-like color to
something a bit closer to white. Less is more and I think that the color draws just a
bit too much attention.
